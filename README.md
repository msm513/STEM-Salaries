# STEM-Salaries

Using data from levels, that contains data about job title, total yearly compensation, bonus and other factors, I used R and Power BI to create visualizations of the data insights and clean the data set and create a linear regression model to find the largest contributors to total yearly compensation. Along with that I also created an explanatory data analysis report.

The STEM Salaries.R file contains the script I created to analyze the data.

The Levels fyi data set is the initial data set analyzed. 

The Sal.csv file is the cleaned data set.

The total yearl compensation is my Power Bi file

STEM Salaries.pptx is the microsoft powerpoint presentaion of findings.
